# Semantic Scholar Citations - Fixed Version 2.1.1

This is the fixed all-in-one version that combines:
- Reliability of v1.0 (single file structure)
- New citation format: XX (number of citation counts)
- No external dependencies

## Files:
- manifest.json - Plugin configuration
- bootstrap.js - All plugin code in one file

## Build:
Simply zip these two files together:
```bash
zip semantic-scholar-citations-fixed-2.1.1.xpi manifest.json bootstrap.js
```

## Why This Works:
- All code in ONE file (no chrome:// URLs)
- No external UI components to load
- Simple and reliable like v1.0
- But with the new citation format you want
